https://github.com/Imgourav007/Dashboard_HospitalityDomain/blob/38ce61555ade04d32453c9aa183180b9b99ff130/Hospitality%20Dashboard%20img.png

## Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating across India for over two decades, faced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business segment. The root causes included poor strategic decisions, lack of timely performance tracking, and absence of an in-house analytics team. This limited managementâ€™s ability to make data-driven decisions and adapt quickly to competitive pressures.

## Task:  
To address these challenges, the revenue management team collaborated with a data analyst to:  
- Analyze historical revenue and operational data across properties.  
- Define and create key performance metrics as per stakeholder requirements.  
- Building an interactive dashboard based on a provided mock-up.  
- Generating additional insights beyond the predefined metrics to support strategic decision-making.

## Tools & Techniques Used:
* Power BI (Power Query, DAX) for data transformation and visualization.
* Excel for initial data exploration and validation.
* Advanced DAX measures for trend analysis and KPI calculations.
* Dynamic filtering for time periods, property types, and locations.

## Results:
* Enabled real-time tracking of occupancy rates, staff efficiency, and revenue trends across 10+ properties.
* Identified underperforming properties and key operational gaps.
* Supported management with timely insights to make informed strategic decisions.
* Improved reporting turnaround time by 30%, enhancing agility in revenue management.
