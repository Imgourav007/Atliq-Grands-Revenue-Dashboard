## Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating across India for over two decades, has recently witnessed a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business segment. The downturn was attributed to poor strategic decisions, a lack of timely performance tracking, and the absence of an in-house analytics team. This hindered the managementâ€™s ability to make data-driven decisions, leaving them vulnerable to growing competition.

## Task:

- To address this issue, the revenue management team decided to engage a third-party data analyst. The key objectives included:
- Analyzing historical revenue and operational data.
- Creating performance metrics as defined by stakeholders.
- Building an interactive dashboard based on a provided mock-up.
- Generating additional insights beyond the predefined metrics to support strategic decision-making.
